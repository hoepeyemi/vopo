> Turn Invoices into Yield. Automatically.

## The Problem

B2B freelancers, consultants, and agencies routinely wait **30-90 days** for invoice payment. That's significant capital sitting idle while DeFi offers 2-7% APY on stablecoins.

**Example:** A freelancer with $50,000 in outstanding invoices loses ~$2,500/year in potential yield.

---

## The Solution

**vasmo** lets crypto-native freelancers earn DeFi yield on unpaid invoices while they wait for payment.

```
Mint Invoice -> Deposit to Vault -> Earn Yield -> Withdraw When Paid
```

- **No lockups** - withdraw anytime
- **No credit checks** - your wallet is your identity
- **No KYC** - permissionless access
- **Privacy-first** - only cryptographic hashes on-chain
- **Multichain** - deploy where your users are

---

## How It Works

1. **Connect** - Link your wallet on any supported chain
2. **Mint** - Create an NFT representing your invoice (data stored as hash)
3. **Deposit** - Put equivalent USDC into yield vault
4. **Earn** - Vault generates real yield via Aave V3
5. **Optimize** - AI agent automatically rebalances between strategies
6. **Withdraw** - Get principal + yield when your client pays

## What Makes This Different

### Not Invoice Factoring
Traditional factoring advances 80-90% cash upfront. We don't provide liquidity - we **optimize yield** on capital you're already waiting for.

### AI-Powered Automation
Our autonomous agent monitors invoices 24/7, analyzing:
- Days until due date
- Risk scores from Pyth oracle data
- Gas prices
- Real-time APY rates from Aave V3

High-confidence decisions (>70%) execute automatically.

### Privacy-First Design
Invoice details never go on-chain. Only cryptographic commitments are stored, enabling selective disclosure.

## Target Users

**Ideal User:**
- Crypto-native freelancer or consultant
- Invoices other businesses (B2B)
- Net-30/60/90 payment terms
- $20K+ in outstanding receivables
- Already has a crypto wallet

---

## Honest Assessment

### What Works
- Invoice tokenization with privacy commitments
- Real DeFi yield via Aave V3 (not simulated)
- AI agent with real LLM analysis
- Multichain deployment (4 chains)

### What Remains Unproven
- Product-market fit with real users
- Unit economics at scale
- Competitive moat vs. using Aave directly
